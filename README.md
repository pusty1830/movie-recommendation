# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using Python, Pandas, and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes a dataset of movies and provides recommendations based on user preferences and similarities between movies.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that suggests movies based on user input, such as movie titles or genres. The system uses content-based filtering methods like **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and **Cosine Similarity** to find and rank similar movies.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similar content (e.g., genre, overview, etc.).
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Extracts important words from movie descriptions to compute similarities.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movies using the TF-IDF vectors.
- **Movie Dataset**: Uses a dataset containing thousands of movies, including attributes like titles, genres, and descriptions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **Movie Title**: The name of the movie.
- **Genres**: The genre(s) the movie belongs to (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
- **Overview**: A short description or plot summary of the movie.

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), containing a large collection of movies and their relevant metadata.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
